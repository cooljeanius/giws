Here is a example of the use of giws with inheritance

Defines where is the JDK
# export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/

# make

Try it !
# ./main

NOTE:
* This is NOT working
inherit.cpp. & inherit.hxx. shows a better solution.
This have been edited by hand and the changes haven't been merged into giws
main code because, in random cases,
sonSecond->fatherMethod() 
is failing.
