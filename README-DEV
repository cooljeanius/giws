giws is working in a few step.

1. Load/Parse the XML file
2. Build in the memory the "tree" of
	* Package
	* Objects
	* Methods
	* Parameters
	* Return types
	* Datatypes
3. Generate the C++ header file
4. Generate the call of Java methods from C++ using JNI



Design patterns :
The design pattern Factory is used to instanciate the different kind of data
that we are managing.
This object is called : dataFactoryGiws and can be called as :

myFactory=dataFactoryGiws()
myData=myFactory.create("int")
