GIWS is basically the opposite of SWIG.

When SWIG generates wrappers to call C/C++ functions/methods from other languages, GIWS creates wrapper for those who wants to call Java methods from C/C++.

Usage :
./giws -h to see the help

Options :

-o / --output-dir= <dir> :
Where files should be generated

-f / --description-file= <file> :
Specify the declaration file to use

-s / --split-per-object :
Creates a file per object instead of a file per package

-v / --version :
Displays the version and other informations

-h / --help :
Displays the help


	

Dependencies :

Obviously, as GIWS has been written in Python, it needs the Python interpretor to work.

For the XML parsing :
python-libxml2
